<p>Dear QCloud user,</p>
<p>We have noticed you are acquiring your QC data using profile mode in both MS1 and MS2. We recommend you to change the MS2 acquisition to centroid mode. In this way the files will be much smaller and the whole pipeline will work faster.
</p>
<p>Thank you for your collaboration.</p>
