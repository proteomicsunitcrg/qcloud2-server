<p>Could you change your QCloud password to a naive one and send it to me? In this way I'll check the QCrawler with your user from outside our network to discard issues with the firewall. Later you'll be able to change the password for a stronger one.</p>
<p>Thank you and sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
