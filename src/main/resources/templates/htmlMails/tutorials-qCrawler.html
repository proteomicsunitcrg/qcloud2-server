<p>Dear X,</p>
<p>
    We checked your files and we saw a good signal for the monitored peptides, so you can start to send data. 
</p>

<p>Now you should add your lab system by following the tutorials in QCloud's Help page "Getting started as a user" and "Getting started as a lab manager".</p>

<p>Finally, you should install the QCrawler which is the program that is going to send your data to our servers. You can also find it in the Help page.</p>

<p>Help page: <a href="http://qcloud2.crg.eu/application/help">http://qcloud2.crg.eu/application/help</a></p>

<p>Please remember to do not upload more than 10 BSA per day and instrument and 5 HeLa per week and instrument in order to do not overload QCloud servers.</p>
