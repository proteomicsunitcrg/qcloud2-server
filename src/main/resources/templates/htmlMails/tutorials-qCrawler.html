<p>Dear X,</p>
<p>
    We checked your files and we saw a good signal for the monitored peptides, so you can start to send data. 
    For this, I would kindly ask you to register again because we are about to release a new QCloud website. You may sign up here: <a href="http://qcloud2.crg.eu/register">QCloud2</a>

<p>Then you should follow this tutorials in order to add your lab system:</p>
